# Deep Rock Galactic Save transfer Tool - Python version
This is a reimplementation of [elibosley](https://github.com/elibosley)'s 
[deep-rock-galactic-save-transfer tool](https://github.com/elibosley/deep-rock-galactic-save-transfer), 
written in Python to prove that Python is better than Javascript. 
(And to learn more about the two languages, and how to script with them.) (But winning is more important.)

This tool allows you to transfer save files for [Deep Rock Galactic](https://store.steampowered.com/app/548430/Deep_Rock_Galactic/)
between the Steam edition of the game, and the Xbox Games Pass edition.

## Usage
1. Copy .env.example to a new .env file, and set the paths to your corresponding copies of the game installed on your
computer. You should just have to change the path to the home folder for your Windows user,
but if you have the game installed on a different drive, it might be somewhere else.

3. Profit
